# algorithms
C++ and Python implementations of some basic algorithms and data structures. For educational purposes.

List of algorithms in C++:

1) Karatsuba multiplication.
2) Calculation of the number of inversions.
3) Quicksort. Recursive, in place, median of three pivot element selection strategy.
4) Karger's algorithm. Randomized algorithm to compute minimum cut of a connected graph.
5) Kosaraju's algorithm - Strongly Connected Components (SCC).
6) Dijkstra's algorithm. "Naive" implementation (whitout heap).
7) Median maintanence. Two heaps.
